# Summary

With a scientific background in ecology, my research has been mainly focused on methods for the study of movement, mainly in [Savanna](https://www.hluhluwegamereserve.com/) but also in the Miami metropolitan area of [South Florida](https://www.broward.org/Parks/Pages/park.aspx?park=40). Despite not stricly ecological topics, Sports Analyzes are an integral part of the literature in Movement Ecology, and benefit from advances in this [scientific field](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00110.pdf).
